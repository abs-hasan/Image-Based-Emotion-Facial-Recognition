# Image-Based-Emotion-Facial-Recognition
Final Project : Image Based-Emotion Facial Recognition

Description:
This project is focused on training and evaluating several deep learning models for emotion recognition using image data. We explore the performance of custom CNN, ResNet50, MobileNet, VGG16, and Inception3 models. The project provides insights into test accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, allowing for a comparison of model performance. Additionally, it delves into the challenges faced, potential future work, and concludes with a summary of the findings. A detailed analysis is also presented through confusion matrices, making it an informative resource for emotion recognition model development.
